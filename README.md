GDLauncher is a custom open source Minecraft launcher written from the ground up in electron/react. Its main goal is to make it easy and enjoyable to manage different Minecraft versions and servers, bringing the playing and modding experience to the next level!

GDLauncher Classic intends to continue this experience on the old codebase of the project. This is mainly a learning experience for me and a few others and we hope you enjoy
